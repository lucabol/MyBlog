I'm Luca Bolognese. 

I'm&nbsp;the Principal Group Program Manager&nbsp;for the C#, VB and F# languages, compilers and IDEs. Before that, I was the LINQ guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that, I was the ObjectSpaces guy.

In my spare time, I read a lot of books. I mean: a lot. I'm not sure how much I retain. I also try to keep some form of physical shape by playing sports and walking.

All in all, I try to recreate my own Italian lifestyle in the&nbsp;Kirkland area.
