I have a sweet spot for [this library](https://github.com/fsprojects/ExcelFinancialFunctions).

I coded it the summer my daughter was born in 2008, while back in Italy for three months. It is one of my first forays into functional programming.

I coded most of them with the sea in front of me. I would bet that it is one of the most Excel-compliant libraries in existence across all languages.

I am happy that the tests (all 199,252 of them) still pass! This is a testament to good backward compatibility in the language.

Thanks to [James](https://github.com/jcoliz) for keeping it alive.
