### Canonical Text History
The canonical text of **_The Odyssey_**, like the _Iliad_, is a reconstructed text based on a critical analysis of various historical documents. These documents are primarily:

* **Papyri fragments:** The earliest surviving fragments of the _Odyssey_ are on papyrus scrolls, some dating to the 3rd century BC. These fragments, found in places like Oxyrhynchus, Egypt, show that the text was relatively stable in antiquity, although some small variations existed.
* **Medieval manuscripts:** These are the most complete and valuable sources for the canonical version of the poem. The most important is likely a **10th-century Byzantine manuscript**, which contains the full text and ancient commentaries (scholia) by Alexandrian scholars. Scholars compare readings from these manuscripts to create the comprehensive modern editions we use today.
