_I have to talk to the school and to the tennis coach after work and need steaks for tonight's dinner and mum wants to chat about my sister  ... but, no wait ... don't think like that ... first things first ... that's what the book says ... first thing, my presentation today ...  did the Boss like it?  He is a smart man, but I wish he could speak more clearly ... must be Diana's graphics ... yeah, a bit unusual but come on! ... and just today the ferry is late ... I am going to be late for work again ..._

_and what the fuck does this guy want?_

"You have beautiful hazel eyes."

_What??_

"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to intrude."

The man was young, embarrassed and went back to his table. Claudia looked at him sternly; thin, nervy, faded jeans, a book on his laps - 'Siddhartha' - and he wasn't young. He had gray in his hair. He wasn't young, but she 'felt him' young. 

At work, she wasn't sure if the presentation went well or badly.  _Focus, Claudia, focus ... what is the problem with you? Go ... ask for feedback ... smile ... smile ... too many things going on in my life ... need more discipline._

"Do you think I have hazel eyes?" she asked her husband, while cooking the steaks.

"I'm not sure. It's not even a color. I like your ass more!" and slapped it for confirmation. That night they made love for the first time in weeks and she relaxed into it.

The morning came and it was raining, and she looked for the man on the ferry and he wasn't there. The day passed and she was not thinking about him. People complimented her for how happy she seemed, but she felt confused.

That night they made love again, but she didn't like it as before. Her husband didn't notice. "Quite a record we are setting here", he said before falling asleep.

In the morning she took a later ferry. The water was choppy and she spilled her coffee.

_My wardrobe ... nothing wearable ... need new clothes, brighter clothes ... show off my ass ... and need to call John for the contract ... isn't 'Siddhartha' for teenagers? ... and who wears faded jeans anymore?_

That night her husband was all over her, but she said no. He turned to the other side and picked up a book. "I guess the streak is over", he commented wryly.

On the last ferry of the day she was looking for him.  _Claudia, please, what are you doing? ... Is this desperation? For what? What are you desperate for?_

The ferry went through a fog bank, small waves hitting the hull and she saw him walking slowly, coffee in hand, careful with it. She felt a lump in her stomach and breathed deeply to calm herself.

She followed him but stopped because she saw where he was going. There was a woman at his table and the woman took the coffee he was carrying, hands careful to avoid any spillage, a timid smile on her face. He touched her arm and her smile widened with uncertainty and delight.

_She is not beautiful. I am more beautiful and I have always been beautiful and she is older than me. I had ... have ... the most beautiful eyes ..._

Her throat burned, her fists clasped ... but then she felt something leaving her, something that was there all along and wasn't there anymore and will not come back.

She was free of it and maybe she would make her husband happy again tonight for he is a good man and father and you got to know what is important in life.

From the booth where the couple sat came a crystal laugh. While outside it was dark and foggy, there was light over the booth, and the man was whispering and the woman had beautiful hazel eyes.
