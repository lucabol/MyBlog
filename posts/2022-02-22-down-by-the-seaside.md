description: "On a moonlit night by the raging sea, a man's heart breaks and a rifle gleams. In this taut tale of betrayal and almost-revenge, watch as nature itself - wind, rain, and salt - conspires to wash away murderous intentions, leaving only the hollow echo of lost love"

The wind batters their face; the sea sings in their ears. The night is yellow with hate. I look at them from my position behind the house. They are like shadows.

She is my girlfriend. I don't know him. They kiss, as I know they would: entwined like a grapevine. A dog barks in the distance. I jump, scared. The moon laughs at us all.

Jenny and I got together a long time ago. We were very young: our hearts pure, our desires less so. We loved each other ferociously: entwined like a grapevine.

She told me she loved me â€” many times. We talked about starting a family together: kids and all. We are engaged now. It is a big deal. And now this.

The rifle shines in the moonlight. It sings my revenge - the joy of the kill - the thrill of the fall.

I point the rifle.

A cloud covers the moon. I lose my target - I lose my resolve. Rain starts to fall. It washes my anger away. I breathe salt in the wind - lower my weapon - head home.

My train leaves tomorrow - a new city waits for me. Jenny is right. We are no more.

The moon shines over the rifle by the side of the house - no clouds in the sky.
