It is rare these days for me to read a book about money that I like. I have read too many of them, so I am a bit jaded. But this one I liked. Here are my notes.

I loved the salt metaphor, something like: "Salt doesn't add taste to food; it enhances the existing flavors. Similarly, money doesn't create happiness; it amplifies the happiness you already have."

## Introduction
- Building wealth isn’t just about working harder; it’s about using the right strategies for your situation.
- Wealth is best understood as a series of levels, each requiring different approaches.

---

## Chapter 1: Spending up the Wealth Ladder
- Spend based on your net worth, not your income, since income can fluctuate.
- The “0.01% Rule” suggests you can safely spend 0.01% of your net worth daily without eroding your wealth.
- Avoid overspending, but extreme frugality isn’t necessary.
- Use your liquid net worth (readily available assets) as a conservative guide for spending.

---

## Chapter 2: Earning up the Wealth Ladder
- Income is the foundation of wealth; high income and high wealth usually go together.
- Different forms of leverage (labor, capital, content, code) become more important as you move up the ladder.

---

## Chapter 3: Investing up the Wealth Ladder
- Those with less wealth tend to own cash, vehicles, and homes; those with more wealth own investments that generate income.
- Moving up the ladder means shifting from assets that cost money to those that make money.
- Owning a business or stocks is common at higher levels, but ownership alone doesn’t guarantee success.
- The key is to gradually increase your share of income-producing assets.

---

## Chapter 4: Level 1 (<$10k) — Atypical Results Require Atypical Actions
- Focus on reducing debt and building a financial safety net.
- Prioritize developing skills that can increase your income, ideally without taking on more debt.
- Rely on relationships for support if needed, and be prepared to reciprocate.
- Avoid large financial risks like high-interest debt or unnecessary loans.

---

## Chapter 5: Level 2 ($10k–$100k) — Learn Today, Earn Forever
- Identify where your skills, interests, and market demand overlap.
- Education that leads to higher earnings is a worthwhile investment at this stage.
- Beware of dead-end jobs and missed opportunities.
- The mindset: invest in learning now to benefit for a lifetime.

---

## Chapter 6: Level 3 ($100k–$1M) — Just Keep Buying
- Research investments that suit you and consider side hustles to diversify income.
- Focus on acquiring income-producing assets and creating multiple income streams.
- Overspending, especially on big purchases like homes, is a major risk.
- Consistency in investing is key; keep building wealth steadily.

---

## Chapter 7: Level 4 ($1M–$10M) — What Got You Here Won’t Get You There
- Decide whether to stay at this level or pursue business ownership for further growth.
- Continued investment and possibly starting or joining a business are main opportunities (you need equity).
- Avoid speculative investments and businesses that are just jobs in disguise (aka they depend on you).
- The strategies that got you to this level may not be enough to move higher.

---

## Chapter 8: Level 5 ($10M–$100M) — Only the Paranoid Survive
- Decide whether to sell your business, start a new one, or stop climbing.
- Scaling or selling businesses is a common path at this level.
- Watch out for concentrated investments, personal liabilities, and the psychological challenges of wealth.
- Protect your wealth and relationships; risk management is crucial.

---

## Chapter 9: Level 6 ($100M+) — Legacy = Action × Wealth
- Focus on safeguarding your wealth and prioritizing non-monetary aspects of life, like relationships and health.
- Consider the impact and legacy you want to leave.
- Major risks include divorce, lawsuits, and taking unnecessary risks.
- At this stage, your actions and how you use your wealth define your legacy.

---

## Chapter 10: How Long Does It Take to Climb the Wealth Ladder?
- Wealth accumulation is a long-term process; most millionaires are in their sixties.
- Upward mobility is possible, especially over decades, but most people remain in the same wealth level over ten years.
- Time and patience are essential; expect gradual progress, not overnight success.

---

## Final Insights
- Money can increase happiness, especially at lower levels, but its impact diminishes as wealth grows.
- True wealth includes social, mental, physical, and time wealth—not just financial assets.
- Balance is key: financial wealth multiplies the value of other forms of wealth, but can’t replace them (salt metaphor).
- The journey up the Wealth Ladder is as much about enjoying life and relationships as it is about accumulating money.
