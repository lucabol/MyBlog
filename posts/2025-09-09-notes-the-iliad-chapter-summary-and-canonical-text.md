## History of the text and canonical sources

The canonical text of the **Iliad** doesn't come from a single, original historical document, but rather from a long tradition of oral and written transmission. The oldest and most important documents that inform our modern version are papyri and medieval manuscripts.

### Papyri
The earliest surviving fragments of the _Iliad_ are on papyrus scrolls. These are crucial because they date back to antiquity, providing a direct link to the text as it existed in the Greco-Roman world.
* **The oldest fragment:** The earliest known fragment is the **"Derveni Papyrus"** from the 4th century BC, though it contains commentary on a section rather than a direct copy of the text.
* **The most significant papyri:** Many papyri fragments, some dating to the 3rd century BC, have been found in places like Oxyrhynchus, Egypt. These often contain only parts of the poem, but they show that the text was relatively stable, although small variations and different versions did exist.

### Medieval Manuscripts
Medieval manuscripts are complete copies of the _Iliad_ text, written on parchment or paper. They are the most complete and valuable sources for the canonical version of the poem.
* **Venetus A:** This 10th-century manuscript is considered the most important source for the _Iliad_. It contains not only the full text of the poem but also extensive scholiaâ€”ancient marginal notes and commentaries by scholars like Aristarchus of Samothrace and Aristophanes of Byzantium. These notes often discuss different versions of lines, textual variants, and interpretations, making the manuscript an invaluable resource for understanding the history of the text. 
* **Venetus B:** Also from the 10th century, this manuscript is another key source. It contains similar scholia and helps to corroborate or clarify the readings in Venetus A.
* **Other medieval manuscripts:** Many other Byzantine manuscripts exist, which scholars use to compare readings and create a comprehensive picture of the text.

In short, the canonical **_Iliad_** is a reconstructed text based on a critical analysis of these various documents. Modern editions are created by comparing the readings from the fragmentary papyri with the more complete medieval manuscripts to arrive at a version that is believed to be the closest to the one used in the ancient world.
