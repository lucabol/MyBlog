I found the book a bit slow and repetitive. Most of it common sense, but there were some frameworks that might be worth preserving here.

## 1. Social Fitness Model

- List your key relationships (family, friends, colleagues).
- Map each relationship on a chart:
  - X-axis: How often do you interact?
  - Y-axis: Does this person energize or deplete you?
- Identify gaps: Who do you want to see more? Who drains you?
- Schedule regular “relationship workouts” (calls, coffees, walks).
- Check in with yourself: Are you investing enough in your most important connections?

## 2. W.I.S.E.R. Model

- **Watch:** Pause and notice your feelings and the situation before reacting.
- **Interpret:** Ask yourself, “What’s really going on? What’s at stake for me and others?”
- **Select:** Consider your options for responding—don’t just react automatically.
- **Engage:** Choose and act on the best response, thoughtfully and intentionally.
- **Reflect:** Afterward, review what happened and what you learned for next time.

## 3. Attention as Asset

- Track where your attention goes each day (work, family, friends, screens).
- Prioritize: Decide who/what deserves your best attention.
- Create rituals: Set device-free times (meals, walks, bedtime).
- Practice “micro-attention”: Give full focus, even for a few minutes, to people you care about.
- Regularly review: Are you spending your attention in line with your values?

## 4. Relationship Keystones

- Assess which types of support you give and receive:
  - Safety & security
  - Learning & growth
  - Emotional closeness/confiding
  - Identity affirmation/shared experience
  - Romantic intimacy
  - Practical help
  - Fun & relaxation
- Identify missing keystones in your relationships.
- Diversify: Don’t expect one person to meet all needs—nurture a variety of connections.

---

## 5. Generosity & Curiosity Spirals

- Look for opportunities to help, support, or show kindness—even in small ways.
- Express gratitude: Thank people for what they do, big or small.
- Ask deeper questions: Move beyond “How are you?” to “What’s something that made you smile today?”
- Be curious about others’ experiences, perspectives, and feelings.
- Notice how generosity and curiosity create more connection and positivity.

---

## 6. Embrace Change & Corrective Experiences

- Remind yourself: Your past does not dictate your future.
- Stay open to new people, experiences, and ways of relating.
- Notice when reality is better than your fears or expectations—let it update your beliefs.
- Seek and accept help when needed; offer it to others.
- Allow yourself to be changed by positive experiences, even if they’re small.

---

## 7. Friendships & Weak Ties

- Value all connections: Close friends, acquaintances, even friendly strangers.
- Engage in small talk: Smile, greet, or chat with people you see regularly (barista, neighbor, coworker).
- Maintain old friendships: Reach out, even if it’s been a while.
- Say yes to invitations or opportunities to connect, even if they seem minor.
- Recognize that even brief, positive interactions can boost your mood and sense of belonging.

---

## 8. Work Relationships

- Invest in work friendships: Eat lunch together, chat, or collaborate on projects.
- Mentor or be mentored: Share knowledge, ask for advice, support others’ growth.
- Acknowledge contributions: Thank coworkers, celebrate team wins.
- Look for meaning in teamwork and helping others at work.
- Balance: Bring positive energy from work home, and vice versa.
