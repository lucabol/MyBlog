It had been a long night for the two brothers. They didn't catch much. They didn't talk much either.

Gabriel was the oldest. Carlos, the wisest. 

That night, it was as if the sea had smashed their faces against the rocks.

"I know about you and Tina," Carlos started. Gabriel glanced at him, face turning red.

A wave hit the boat. Gabriel swore. They struggled to regain their balance.

Carlos looked down: "This is the last time we ever talk about this." Gabriel nodded, tears glistening in his eyes.

They pulled up the nets and headed home.

As they reached shore, a wave hit the boat. Gabriel swore. The sun came out and turned the night red.
