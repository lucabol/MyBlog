As few people have asked for my opinion. Here it is in very concise form.

It depends on your goal and it is all very debatable.

To fundamentally understand programming, I like a 'barbell' strategy. One language close to the machine
and one that is very abstract:
* C (the machine)
* Haskell (the abstractions)

Bonus shouts to Racket (macros), Prolog (logical programming) and Erlang (concurrency).

The other languages are pragmatic compromises of the fundamental concepts that are learned
more purely with the languages above this line.

F# is a good compromise between machine and abstractions and might be a good
way to kill two birds with one stone.

To be productive immediately and find (easily?) remote (low?) paying jobs as web developer:
* HTML (not really a language)
* CSS (not really a language)
* Javascript

Bonus shout to Typescript.

To work in the corporate world for an obscene amount of money: 
* C#
* Java

Bonus shouts to Powershell and Bash for automation; Rust to look cool to the hiring manager.

To work as a data scientist (AI AI AI ...):
* Python
* C++

... And a good math background. Bonus shouts to R and Julia.

There are fantastic books on all these languages. Everyone has his favorite.

I also have no idea what is best to teach young people as I have never done it.

They probably prefer to build funny stuff (i.e., games) which is not trivial with my 'fundamental choices'
of C and Haskell. Compromises need to be made.

I know there is a good Racket [book](https://www.amazon.com/Realm-Racket-Learn-Program-Game/dp/1593274912)
along those lines. Perhaps there are others. I have not investigated the matter.
