### **1. Plato, *Apology* and *Crito***

* ***Apology***
    * **Socrates's Defense:** Socrates defends himself against the long-standing prejudices that he is a "wise man," a natural philosopher, and a Sophist. He recounts the story of the Oracle at Delphi, which claimed no man was wiser than Socrates, leading him to question others and discover his own wisdom lies in knowing he knows nothing.
    * **The Formal Charges:** He responds to the formal charges of corrupting the youth and not believing in the city's gods. He argues that he is a public benefactor, not a corrupter, and that his mission comes from the god Apollo. He claims the state will harm itself more by killing him than he has ever harmed anyone.
    * **The Verdict:** The jury finds him guilty. When asked to propose a penalty, he suggests free meals for life, but ultimately accepts death, concluding that an unexamined life is not worth living and a good man cannot be harmed by a bad one.

* ***Crito***
    * **Crito's Plea:** Crito arrives with a plan for Socrates to escape. He argues that Socrates's death would be a misfortune for his friends, and that by not escaping, Socrates would be abandoning his children and appearing to choose an easy path.
    * **Socrates's Refutation:** Socrates convinces Crito that one should not value the opinion of the many but only the wise. He then personifies the Laws of Athens to argue that he has an implicit social contract with the city. By choosing to live his whole life in Athens, he agreed to obey its laws and judgments. He concludes that escaping would be an act of injustice against the very laws that have protected and educated him, and that it is never right to return injustice for injustice.

### **2. Plato, *The Republic*, Books I & II**

* ***Book I***
    * **The Problem of Justice:** The dialogue opens with a discussion on the nature of justice among Socrates and his friends.
    * **Cephalus's Definition:** Cephalus defines justice as being honest and paying back what one owes, but Socrates refutes this with an example: returning a weapon to a madman.
    * **Polemarchus's Definition:** Polemarchus defines justice as helping friends and harming enemies. Socrates argues that it's difficult to know who is a true friend or enemy and that justice should not involve harming anyone.
    * **Thrasymachus's Challenge:** The Sophist Thrasymachus bursts into the conversation, declaring that "justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger." He argues that injustice, if successful, is more profitable than justice. Socrates refutes this by arguing that injustice creates disharmony and can't lead to a good life.

* ***Book II***
    * **The Ring of Gyges:** Glaucon challenges Socrates to defend justice for its own sake, apart from its reputation or rewards. He introduces the story of the Ring of Gyges, which grants invisibility, arguing that any person would act unjustly if they could get away with it.
    * **The Just and Unjust Man:** Glaucon asks Socrates to compare the life of a perfectly just man who is thought to be unjust and the life of a perfectly unjust man who has a reputation for being just.
    * **The City-Soul Analogy:** To address this challenge, Socrates proposes that they first examine justice on a larger scale by building an ideal city, arguing that justice will be easier to see and define in a state than in an individual.

***

### **3. Sophocles, *Oedipus the King* and *Antigone***

* ***Oedipus the King***
    * **The Oracle:** King Oedipus vows to find the murderer of the previous king, Laius, to end a plague ravaging Thebes.
    * **The Prophecy:** He consults the blind prophet Tiresias, who reveals that Oedipus himself is the murderer. Oedipus, enraged, accuses Tiresias and Creon of conspiracy.
    * **The Unraveling:** He learns that Laius was killed at a crossroads and that he, Oedipus, killed an old man at that very spot. He also discovers he was a foundling, and that he was given away by a shepherd to avoid a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother.
    * **The Truth Revealed:** Oedipus realizes he has unknowingly fulfilled the prophecy. His mother/wife Jocasta kills herself. Oedipus blinds himself with her dress pins and begs to be exiled.

* ***Antigone***
    * **The Conflict:** Antigone's brothers have died fighting each other. Creon, the new king, decrees that one, Eteocles, will be buried honorably, but the other, Polyneices, will be left unburied as a traitor. Antigone defies this law, believing her duty to the gods and her family is a higher law than the king's decree.
    * **Defiance and Condemnation:** Antigone is caught burying her brother's body. She defends her actions to Creon, who, enraged by her defiance, sentences her to be buried alive in a cave.
    * **The Prophet:** The blind prophet Tiresias warns Creon that the gods are displeased and that his pride will lead to tragedy. Creon finally changes his mind but it is too late.
    * **The Tragic End:** A messenger reports that Antigone has hanged herself, and Creon's son, Haemon, has killed himself upon finding her. When Creon's wife, Eurydice, hears of her son's death, she also kills herself. Creon is left with nothing.

***

### **4. Aristotle, *Nicomachean Ethics*, Book I**

* **Chapter 1:** All human action aims at some good, but these goods are ordered in a hierarchy. The highest good, which all others aim for, is the subject of political science.
* **Chapter 2:** The highest good is happiness (*eudaimonia*), which is pursued for its own sake and not for the sake of anything else.
* **Chapter 3:** The study of ethics is not an exact science. Young people, lacking life experience, are not yet ready to study it.
* **Chapter 4:** Everyone agrees the highest good is happiness, but they disagree on what it is. The masses equate it with pleasure or wealth.
* **Chapter 5:** Aristotle distinguishes three types of life: the life of pleasure, the political life (seeking honor), and the contemplative life (seeking truth), which he says is the highest.
* **Chapter 6:** He rejects the Platonic idea of a single, universal "Good."
* **Chapter 7:** The highest good must be found in the proper "function" of a human being, which is an activity of the rational soul in accordance with virtue.
* **Chapter 8:** External goods like wealth and friends are also needed for happiness, but only as instruments.
* **Chapter 9:** Happiness is the result of both learning and habit. It can be acquired through effort.
* **Chapter 10-11:** A person can be called happy only when their life has concluded, as a person's fortune can change. The fortunes of one's descendants or friends have only a slight effect on one's own happiness after death.
* **Chapter 12-13:** Happiness is a "final" good. The soul has a rational part and an irrational part that can be guided by reason. Virtue is divided into intellectual virtue (gained through teaching) and moral virtue (gained through habit).

***

### **5. Aristotle, *Politics*, Book I**

* **Chapter 1:** Aristotle argues that the state is the highest and most complete form of human association, formed for the sake of the highest good.
* **Chapter 2:** He explains how the city-state is a natural development from the family and village. He introduces his famous idea that "man is by nature a political animal."
* **Chapter 3:** He breaks down the household into its three main relationships: master and slave, husband and wife, and parent and child. He says that understanding the household is necessary for understanding the state.
* **Chapter 4:** He discusses the nature of slavery, arguing that there are "natural slaves," those who are born to be ruled.
* **Chapter 5:** He refines his definition of a natural slave, arguing that a master who only rules by force is not a true master. He contrasts natural slavery with legal slavery (e.g., of a conquered enemy).
* **Chapter 6:** He considers the "art of acquisition" or the household's ability to acquire goods. He distinguishes between natural acquisition (enough to meet one's needs) and unnatural acquisition (wealth-getting for its own sake).
* **Chapter 7:** He contrasts the art of household management with the art of moneymaking, arguing that the latter is without a natural end.
* **Chapter 8:** He continues his critique of moneymaking, especially the practice of charging interest, which he calls "unnatural."
* **Chapter 9-10:** He considers the roles of women and children in the household, arguing that the virtue of a woman is different from that of a man, and that children should be educated for the state. He concludes that the virtue of a slave is also different.
* **Chapter 11:** He concludes the book by emphasizing that the household is the basic unit of society and that a strong state depends on well-managed households.

### **6. Plutarch, *The Lives***

Plutarch's work is a collection of biographies. This reading plan focuses on a selection of four.

* ***The Life of Lycurgus***
    * **The Constitution:** Lycurgus establishes a new constitution, which divides land equally, forbids the use of gold and silver money, and establishes a Senate to balance the power of the king.
    * **The *Agoge*:** He creates the Spartan system of education, a rigorous training regimen for young men.
    * **Customs:** He establishes common messes (dining halls) where all citizens eat together to foster equality and simplicity.
    * **His Legacy:** He ensures his laws remain in effect forever by leaving Sparta and never returning.

* ***The Life of Numa Pompilius***
    * **The Religious Reforms:** Numa is chosen as the second king of Rome. He establishes a new calendar and various priesthoods (such as the Vestal Virgins). He focuses on instilling a sense of reverence and piety in the Roman people to turn them away from their warlike ways.
    * **His Peaceful Rule:** Unlike Romulus, Numa rules by persuasion and religious authority. His rule is a time of great prosperity and harmony, and he is remembered as a peaceful and wise king.

* ***The Life of Alexander***
    * **Early Life:** Alexander is tutored by Aristotle, who instills in him a love for philosophy.
    * **Conquests:** He inherits his father's kingdom and embarks on a campaign to conquer the Persian Empire, creating a vast empire from Greece to India.
    * **His Legacy:** Plutarch portrays him as a complex figure, a brilliant leader whose passion for glory was a double-edged sword.

* ***The Life of Caesar***
    * **Political Career:** Plutarch traces Caesar's rise through the Roman political ranks, highlighting his ambition and ability to win over the people.
    * **Military Campaigns:** He details Caesar's conquest of Gaul, his famous crossing of the Rubicon, and his subsequent civil war against Pompey.
    * **The Dictatorship:** Caesar becomes the sole ruler of Rome, a dictator for life.
    * **Assassination:** He is assassinated by senators who feared his power. Plutarch portrays him as a man of extraordinary talent and ambition, whose rise to power ultimately led to the end of the Roman Republic.

***

### **7. *The Old Testament*, The Book of Job**

* **The Wager:** The story begins with a wealthy and righteous man, Job, who is tested by Satan. Satan wagers with God that Job's piety is only a result of his good fortune. God permits Satan to afflict Job, so long as he does not kill him.
* **The Affliction:** Job loses all his children, his wealth, and his health, suffering from painful boils. Despite his wife's urging to "curse God and die," Job maintains his faith, though he laments his birth and longs for death.
* **The Friends:** Three friends—Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar—visit Job. They believe his suffering must be a punishment for some sin he has committed. Job argues with them, maintaining his innocence and questioning God's justice.
* **The Whirlwind:** A young man named Elihu joins the conversation, criticizing both Job and his friends. Finally, God appears to Job from a whirlwind and speaks of his own power and the incomprehensibility of his creation. God's response does not explain why Job suffered but rather overwhelms Job with the vastness of divine wisdom. Job humbles himself and acknowledges his limited human understanding.
* **Restoration:** God restores Job's health and wealth, and gives him a new family, blessing him with twice as much as he had before.

***

### **8. St. Augustine, *The Confessions*, Books I–VIII**

* **Autobiography and Praise:** Augustine's work is a spiritual autobiography written as a long prayer to God. He recounts his early life and spiritual journey, beginning with his birth and childhood.
* **Early Sins and Education:** He confesses to the small sins of his youth, like stealing pears from a neighbor's tree, and reflects on the nature of evil. He describes his formal education, his love of rhetoric, and his early intellectual pursuits.
* **Intellectual and Spiritual Crisis:** Augustine details his intellectual and spiritual wandering, including his long adherence to the Manichaean religion, which held that good and evil were separate, equal forces. He struggles with his lusts and desires, which he sees as a primary barrier to his conversion.
* **The Road to Conversion:** He grows disillusioned with Manichaeism and is influenced by the sermons of St. Ambrose. He also reads the works of the Neoplatonists, which helps him to see God as an incorporeal, all-good being, and evil as the absence of good.
* **The Garden Experience:** His conversion culminates in a famous scene in a garden. In great spiritual turmoil, he hears a child's voice chanting, "Tolle lege! Tolle lege!" ("Take up and read! Take up and read!"). He opens the book of St. Paul's Epistles and reads a passage that convinces him to give up his sinful life and fully commit to Christianity.

***

### **9. Montaigne, *The Essays***

* **A New Form of Writing:** Michel de Montaigne essentially created the essay genre. His essays are personal, reflective, and conversational, exploring a wide range of topics from his own experiences and reading.
* **Self-Examination:** The central theme is the study of the self. Montaigne's famous motto, "Que sçay-je?" ("What do I know?"), reflects his skeptical and introspective approach. He uses his own life, habits, and opinions as a case study to explore human nature in general.
* **Human Nature:** He portrays human beings as complex, contradictory, and inconsistent. He critiques human arrogance and ethnocentrism, arguing that no single way of life or culture is superior. He finds folly in those who claim absolute certainty and instead advocates for humility and a healthy skepticism.
* **Education and Death:** He writes on the importance of an education that emphasizes experience and application over rote memorization. He also famously advises on how to prepare for death, arguing that to philosophize is to learn how to die and that facing our mortality can help us to live more fully.

***

### **10. Shakespeare, *Hamlet***

* **The Ghost's Command:** The play opens at Elsinore Castle in Denmark, where Prince Hamlet is mourning the death of his father, the king. The ghost of the late king appears to Hamlet and reveals that he was murdered by his brother, Claudius, who has since usurped the throne and married Hamlet's mother, Gertrude. The ghost commands Hamlet to seek revenge.
* **Feigned Madness:** Hamlet, torn between action and thought, feigns madness as a way to investigate the crime and plan his revenge. This puts him at odds with Claudius and his mother, and leads to him spurning the affection of his beloved Ophelia.
* **The Play-Within-a-Play:** To test Claudius's guilt, Hamlet stages a play that re-enacts the murder of his father. When Claudius storms out, it confirms his guilt for Hamlet.
* **Tragedy and Death:** Hamlet's hesitation leads to a chain of tragic events. He accidentally kills Polonius (Ophelia's father) and is sent to England by Claudius with a plot for his death. Hamlet escapes and returns, only to find Ophelia has gone mad and drowned. Her brother, Laertes, conspires with Claudius to kill Hamlet in a rigged duel. In the final scene, Gertrude, Laertes, Claudius, and Hamlet are all killed. Hamlet's friend Horatio is the sole survivor, left to tell the tragic story.

### **11. John Locke, *Concerning Civil Government***

* **State of Nature and Natural Law:** Locke argues that in a **state of nature**, all individuals are free and equal, bound only by **natural law**. This law dictates that no one should harm another's life, liberty, or property, because these are God-given rights.
* **Property and Government:** He defines property as something created by mixing one's labor with nature. The purpose of government is to protect these natural rights. Since individuals are not always good at enforcing natural law on their own, they form a **social contract** to create a government.
* **Consent of the Governed:** Legitimate government is based on the **consent of the governed**. The people delegate their power to the government to ensure their rights are protected. If the government becomes a tyranny and infringes upon the people's rights, the people have a right to revolt and establish a new government.
* **Separation of Powers:** To prevent tyranny, Locke advocates for a **separation of powers**, primarily between the legislative and executive branches. The legislative branch, which represents the people, is supreme.

***

### **12. Jonathan Swift, *Gulliver's Travels***

* **A Satirical Voyage:** The book is a satirical critique of human nature and European society, told through the fictional voyages of Lemuel Gulliver.
* **Lilliput:** In the land of Lilliput, a nation of six-inch-tall people, Gulliver observes their petty squabbles and absurd customs. The conflict between Lilliput and its rival, Blefuscu, over which end of an egg should be cracked, satirizes the religious and political conflicts of Swift's time.
* **Brobdingnag:** In Brobdingnag, a land of giants, Gulliver is now tiny. He recounts the details of English society to the King of Brobdingnag, who is disgusted by the violence and corruption he hears about. The king's judgment serves as Swift's critique of the moral depravity of European civilization.
* **Laputa and the Houyhnhnms:** Later voyages take him to Laputa, a floating island inhabited by impractical academics, which satirizes the uselessness of abstract knowledge and science. His final journey takes him to the land of the Houyhnhnms, a race of rational, virtuous horses who rule over the Yahoos, brutish, human-like creatures. Gulliver is so disgusted by the Yahoos and enamored with the Houyhnhnms that he becomes ashamed to be a human, representing Swift's ultimate, misanthropic view of humanity.

***

### **13. Edward Gibbon, *The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire***

* **A Comprehensive History:** Gibbon's massive work is a detailed historical account of the Roman Empire from its peak in the second century to the fall of the Western Empire in 476 CE and the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453.
* **Causes of Decline:** Gibbon argues that the decline was caused by a combination of internal and external factors. He points to the loss of civic virtue, the rise of corruption, internal conflicts, and the pressure of barbarian invasions.
* **The Role of Christianity:** A controversial aspect of Gibbon's work is his argument that the rise of Christianity contributed to the empire's decline. He contends that the new religion redirected the energies of the populace away from civic and military duties toward spiritual and monastic pursuits. He also argues that the religious disputes of the Christian Church created internal discord that weakened the empire.
* **Historical Legacy:** While modern historians debate many of Gibbon's specific claims, his work remains a foundational text in the study of Roman history and a masterpiece of historical prose.

***

### **14. American State Papers and *The Federalist***

* **The *Federalist Papers*:** A collection of 85 essays written by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay under the pseudonym "Publius." Their purpose was to persuade the citizens of New York to ratify the newly proposed U.S. Constitution.
* **Purpose of Government:** The essays address the need for a strong central government to ensure stability and protect against both internal factionalism and external threats.
* **Key Arguments:** They lay out the foundational principles of the new American Republic, including:
    * **Federalist No. 10 (Madison):** Argues that a large republic is the best way to control the dangers of political factions, as a larger number of interests would prevent any single group from dominating.
    * **Federalist No. 51 (Madison):** Explains the necessity of **checks and balances** and the **separation of powers** among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful.
    * **Federalist No. 78 (Hamilton):** Defends the power of the judiciary, arguing for **judicial review** and an independent judiciary to protect the Constitution.

***

### **15. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, *Manifesto of the Communist Party***

* **Class Struggle:** The *Manifesto* presents a historical analysis of society as a history of class struggle. The authors argue that capitalism has simplified this conflict into two main classes: the **bourgeoisie** (the owners of the means of production) and the **proletariat** (the working class).
* **The Oppression of the Proletariat:** Marx and Engels argue that the bourgeoisie, driven by the need for profit, exploit the proletariat. They contend that the capitalist system alienates workers from their labor, their products, and each other.
* **The Inevitable Revolution:** The *Manifesto* predicts that the increasing misery of the proletariat will inevitably lead to a revolution. The workers will overthrow the bourgeoisie and seize control of the means of production.
* **The Communist Program:** It outlines a ten-point program for a new, communist society, which includes the abolition of private property, a heavy progressive income tax, free education for all children in public schools, and the centralization of credit and communication in the hands of the state. It concludes with the famous rallying cry: **"Workingmen of all countries, unite!"**
