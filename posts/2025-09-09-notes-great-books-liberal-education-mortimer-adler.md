### **4. Aristotle, *Nicomachean Ethics*, Book I**

* **The Highest Good:** Aristotle argues that all human actions aim at some good, with the highest good being **happiness** (*eudaimonia*), which is pursued for its own sake.
* **The Function of Man:** Happiness is an "activity of the rational soul in accordance with virtue." To be truly happy, a person must use their unique human capacity for reason.

### **8. St. Augustine, *The Confessions*, Books I–VIII**

* **Spiritual Journey:** Written as a prayer to God, Augustine's work is a spiritual autobiography recounting his early life and struggles.
* **Early Sins:** He reflects on the nature of evil, confessing to minor sins of his youth, and sees his own lusts and worldly ambitions as a primary barrier to his faith.
* **Intellectual Crisis:** He recounts his long adherence to the Manichaean religion and his eventual embrace of Neoplatonism, which helped him see evil as the absence of good.
* **The Garden Conversion:** His spiritual journey climaxes in a garden when he hears a voice telling him to "Take up and read!" He opens a book of Paul's Epistles and is immediately convinced to give up his sinful life.

### **9. Montaigne, *The Essays***

* **The Essay:** Montaigne pioneered the essay genre, writing personal, reflective pieces that explore a wide range of topics.
* **Self-Examination:** His main focus is on the study of the self, reflecting his skeptical motto, **"Que sçay-je?"** ("What do I know?").
* **Human Nature:** He presents a complex view of human nature, critiquing human arrogance and advocating for humility and a healthy skepticism.
* **On Death:** He famously argues that to philosophize is to learn how to die and that facing one's mortality can help one to live more fully.
* **Specific Essays:**
    * **"Of Pedantry":** Montaigne criticizes the pedants of his time for valuing book learning and memorization over true wisdom and judgment. He argues that knowledge is useless if not integrated and applied to life.
    * **"That It Is Folly to Measure Truth and Error by Our Own Capacity":** He argues against intellectual arrogance and dogmatism, suggesting that we should not assume our own limited reason is the measure of all things. He emphasizes the vastness of the unknown and the diversity of human beliefs.
    * **"Of Cannibals":** He uses the example of a "savage" tribe to critique the barbarism and ethnocentrism of European society.
    * **"That the Relish of Good and Evil Depends in a Great measure upon the Opinion we Have of Them":** Montaigne explores the power of our minds to shape our experience of the world. He argues that our opinions, attitudes, and imaginings have a greater impact on our happiness and suffering than external events themselves.
    * **"Of the Education of Children":** He advocates for an education that emphasizes reason and judgment over rote memorization and encourages exposure to different cultures.

* **Social Contract:** To protect these rights, people enter a **social contract** to create a government.
* **Consent and Tyranny:** Legitimate government is based on the **consent of the governed**. If a government becomes tyrannical and infringes on these rights, the people have a right to revolt.

### **12. Jonathan Swift, *Gulliver's Travels***

* **Satire:** The book is a satirical critique of human nature and European society.
* **The Voyages:**
    * In **Lilliput**, a land of tiny people, Swift satirizes the pettiness of political and religious conflicts.
    * In **Brobdingnag**, a land of giants, Gulliver is small, and the king's disgust at English society highlights its moral corruption.
    * In **Laputa**, a flying island populated by people obsessed with mathematics and music but lacking common sense, he satirizes abstract and impractical thinking.
    * In the land of the **Houyhnhnms**, rational horses rule over the brutish, human-like **Yahoos**. Gulliver becomes so disgusted with humanity that he longs to be a horse.

### **13. Edward Gibbon, *The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire***

* **The Scope:** The reading selection focuses on Gibbon's controversial analysis of Christianity's role in the fall of the empire.
* **Chapter 15: The Progress of the Christian Religion:** Gibbon investigates the "five secondary causes" for the rapid spread of Christianity, beyond divine intervention. These include the **zeal of the early Christians**, their doctrine of a future life (including the concept of heaven and hell), the claim to miraculous powers, the **pure and austere morals** of the believers, and the tight-knit **union and discipline of the Christian Church**.
* **Chapter 16: The Conduct of the Roman Government toward the Christians:** This chapter details the various persecutions of the Christians. Gibbon argues that the Roman government's intolerance was rooted in the Christians' refusal to participate in the traditional pagan rites, which the Romans viewed as a civic duty. He contrasts the Roman policy of general religious tolerance with their harshness toward the Christians' "inflexible obstinacy." He also controversially estimates the number of Christian martyrs to be far lower than traditional Christian accounts, and attributes their willingness to face death to fanaticism rather than pure faith.

### **14. American State Papers and *The Federalist***

* **Declaration of Independence:** This document asserts the **unalienable rights** to "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness," and states that governments derive their power from the **consent of the governed**.
* **The Constitution of the United States of America:** This establishes the framework for the U.S. government, including the **three branches of government** (legislative, executive, and judicial), the **system of checks and balances**, and the division of powers between the federal government and the states.

    * **No. 1 (Hamilton):** An introduction to the series, outlining the need for a new Constitution and the topics to be covered.
