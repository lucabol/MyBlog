### **The Prince: A Chapter-by-Chapter Summary**


### **Chapters 1-11: Types of Principalities**

* **Chapter 1:** Machiavelli opens by categorizing principalities, or states ruled by a single person, as either hereditary or new.
* **Chapter 2:** He argues that **hereditary principalities** are easier to rule because people are accustomed to the ruling family.
* **Chapter 3:** This is one of the longest chapters, detailing the difficulties in governing **mixed principalities**â€”newly acquired territories added to an older state. He advises that a ruler should either live in the new territory or establish colonies there.
* **Chapter 4:** Machiavelli explains why the kingdom of Darius, conquered by Alexander the Great, did not rebel after Alexander's death. He distinguishes between two types of monarchies: one where the prince rules with a powerful nobility, and another where he rules as an absolute authority.
* **Chapter 5:** He discusses how to govern states that were previously free. The most secure way is to destroy them, the next best is for the prince to reside there, and the riskiest is to allow them to keep their old laws and just impose a tax.
* **Chapter 6:** This chapter focuses on **new principalities acquired by a prince's own ability and arms**. He uses figures like Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, and Theseus as examples, arguing that great difficulty lies in establishing a new order but that once it's established, it becomes stable.
* **Chapter 7:** This chapter is a contrast to the last, focusing on **principalities acquired by the arms of others or by fortune**. He uses **Cesare Borgia** as his primary example, showing that while such a prince may rise quickly, he lacks a strong foundation and is vulnerable to misfortune.
* **Chapter 8:** Machiavelli examines principalities acquired through wicked means or crime. He argues that while a prince may gain power this way, it will not bring him glory or a lasting reputation.
* **Chapter 9:** He discusses **civil principalities**, where a ruler gains power with the support of the people or the nobles. He argues it's better to have the support of the people, as they are a more reliable base of power than the fickle nobles.
* **Chapter 10:** This chapter discusses how to measure the strength of a principality, specifically whether a prince can defend himself or needs external help.
* **Chapter 11:** He explains how to govern **ecclesiastical principalities** (like the Papal States), which he says are the easiest to maintain because they are upheld by religious institutions and tradition.

### **Chapters 12-14: Military Matters**

* **Chapter 12:** This chapter is a sharp critique of different types of military forces. Machiavelli argues that the foundation of any state is a strong military and that a prince must rely on his **own troops**, not mercenaries. He argues that mercenaries are disloyal and dangerous.
* **Chapter 13:** He extends his critique to **auxiliary troops** (forces borrowed from another prince), stating that they are even more dangerous than mercenaries. A wise prince would rather lose with his own army than win with another's.
* **Chapter 14:** The prince's primary focus should be on military matters. He must constantly study the art of war, both in practice (through hunting and knowing the terrain) and in theory (by studying history and the actions of great commanders).

### **Chapters 15-23: The Prince's Qualities and Conduct**

* **Chapter 15:** Machiavelli outlines the qualities that a prince should and shouldn't have. He famously states that a prince must learn **"how not to be good"** when necessary, as acting virtuously at all times can lead to ruin.
* **Chapter 16:** He explores the tension between **generosity and parsimony**. He advises that it is better for a prince to be parsimonious (stingy) to avoid burdening the people with taxes.
* **Chapter 17:** This is one of the most famous chapters, addressing whether it's better to be **feared or loved**. Machiavelli concludes that a prince should wish to be both but, since it is difficult, it is much safer to be feared. However, he must avoid being hated.
* **Chapter 18:** Machiavelli argues that a prince must be both a **lion** (to frighten off wolves) and a **fox** (to recognize traps). He states that a prince should not always keep his word if it puts him at a disadvantage.
* **Chapter 19:** He explains the importance of avoiding contempt and hatred, which are caused by being perceived as greedy, effeminate, or indecisive. A prince should appear dignified, courageous, and resolute.
* **Chapter 20:** This chapter explores various security measures, like building fortresses, and whether a prince should disarm his subjects or sow divisions among them. He advises that fortresses are useful but not a substitute for the goodwill of the people.
* **Chapter 21:** He discusses what a prince must do to gain reputation, such as engaging in great enterprises and being a firm ally or enemy.
* **Chapter 22:** Machiavelli advises on choosing ministers. He states that a good minister must be loyal and honest, and that a prince can tell a minister's quality by how he acts in the prince's best interest.
* **Chapter 23:** He warns the prince to avoid flatterers and to choose a few wise advisers who will tell him the truth.

### **Chapters 24-26: The State of Italy and a Call to Action**

* **Chapter 24:** Machiavelli discusses why the princes of Italy have lost their states. He attributes their failures to their reliance on mercenaries, their failure to prepare for adversity, and their lack of a strong connection with their people.
* **Chapter 25:** He explores the role of **fortune** versus free will. He argues that fortune controls about half of our actions, but that a prince must be prepared to act decisively and take risks to control the other half. 
* **Chapter 26:** This final chapter is a passionate plea for a new prince to liberate Italy from foreign powers. He presents a vision for a strong, unified Italian state led by a prince who can apply the lessons of the book.

### **Canonical Text History**

The canonical text of **_The Prince_** is not based on a long line of ancient manuscripts like Homer's epics. Instead, its textual history is relatively straightforward. The text is based on a single, original manuscript from the 16th century.

* **The Original Manuscript:** The book was written by Machiavelli around **1513** while he was exiled from Florence. He wrote it as a gift to Lorenzo de' Medici, though it was not formally published during his lifetime.

* **First Published Editions:** The first official editions of _The Prince_ were published posthumously in **1532**. These early printed books are the basis for all modern editions.

* **Later Revisions and Editions:** While later editions have corrected minor typographical errors and standardized punctuation, the core text has remained largely unchanged since the first publication. The book's controversial nature led to it being banned by the Catholic Church, but this did not stop its widespread circulation and influence.
